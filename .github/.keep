##  QUESTION 1 
GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. Its key features include version control, branching, pull requests for code review and merging changes, issue tracking, and project documentation. These tools facilitate efficient collaboration among developers, enabling them to work on code together, manage tasks, and maintain project quality.


## QUESTION 2
A GitHub repository is a storage space where project files and their history are stored using Git version control. To create a new repository:

Creating a Repository: On GitHub, click on "New" and fill in the repository details (name, description, public/private status).

Essential Elements:

README: Markdown file explaining the project, its purpose, and how to use it.
License: Specifies how others can use the code.
.gitignore: Lists files that Git should ignore (e.g., temporary files, build outputs).
Version Control with Git: Git tracks changes to files, allowing multiple developers to collaborate by managing branches, merging changes, and reverting to previous versions.


## QUESTION 3
GitHub enhances Git's version control by providing a platform for hosting repositories with features like branching, merging, and pull requests. These tools enable parallel development, seamless collaboration, and effective code review, ensuring efficient project management and quality control.


## QUESTION 4
A pull request in GitHub lets you propose changes to a repository. It facilitates collaboration by allowing others to review your code before merging it. Hereâ€™s how:

Creating a Pull Request:

Make changes in a new branch.
Push the branch to GitHub.
Open a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.
Reviewing a Pull Request:

Team members review the code, leave comments, and suggest improvements.
Discussions and revisions happen until changes are approved.
GitHub Actions automates workflows like building, testing, and deploying code directly from GitHub, triggered by events like commits or pull requests. This improves productivity and ensures consistent development practices.
